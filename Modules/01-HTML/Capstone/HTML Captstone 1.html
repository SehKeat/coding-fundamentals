                    <p>Hi, I'm Seh Keat &#128516;. I am an engineer from Malaysia, currently working as a product engineer in Bangi. I graduated with bachelor degree of Mechatronic Engineering from <a href="https://www.ucsiuniversity.edu.my" target="_blank">UCSI university</a>.</p>

                    <p>During my final year as a student, I have help worked on a research and publish the <a href="https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfpp.15576" target="_blank">paper</a> together with food science department regarding physicochemical analysis and adulteration detection in Malaysia stingless bee honey using a handheld near-infrared spectrometer. My goal in this research to differentiate the adulteration and purity level of local stingless bee honey. Along the research journey, I have use the following tools:</p>

Classification techniques from Orange such as principal component analysis (PCA) to find the outliers and best data and machine learning algorithm to create the classification models such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, random forest and neural network.</td>

                    <p>After working for almost 3 year as a sales engineer and now a product engineer, I found out that to advance or focus on technical stuff for Mechatronic engineer such as Robotis, automation and etc are rather limited in Malaysia except Penang and often required you to do travelling outstation especially when you work as an project engineer in KL. While sales engineer is rather enjoyable for me, I want to step out of my comfort zone and get into the tech industry and look for a job around KL, Putrajaya and Selangor in the future.</p>
                    <p>Currently I am still working while self learning with Scrimba and Sigma School now. I will plan to transition from part time learning to full time learning soon as I want to accelerate my progress into the industry. </p>
